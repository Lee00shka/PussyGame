<a>A game developed by Unity 2D. you play as a cat. You need to fool all the kitties in different locations, while if you have fooled one, then you need not to catch the eye of the second. Kitties move freely around the location. You can also use various auxiliary distraction mechanisms (For example: turn on the laser pointer, to which all the kitties who see the red dot will come running)</a>
